This Streamlit app allows users to rewrite a given text in different tones and dialects using OpenAI's language model. Here's a brief overview of its functionality:

1. User Input:
OpenAI API Key: Users need to input their OpenAI API key to proceed with the text transformation.
Draft Text: Users enter the text they want to re-write (with a limit of 50 words).
2. Tone and Dialect Selection:
Users can select the tone (Formal or Informal) and dialect (American, British, or Turkish) for the transformation.
3. Text Processing:
The app generates a prompt with the selected tone and dialect, and uses OpenAI's language model (via Langchain) to process and re-write the input text accordingly.
4. Output:
The re-written text is displayed to the user, with the specified tone and dialect applied.
5. Error Handling:
The app checks if the API key and text are valid and displays error messages if necessary.
Summary:
This app provides a user-friendly interface for transforming text into various tones and dialects using AI.
